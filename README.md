# RSA in Julia
A simple implementation of RSA in the Julia language.

Originally written for the students of CSE 13S at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

This is just a demonstration. A truly secure version is much more careful
with its selection of *p* and *q* to avoid known attacks.

# Usage

```
(e, d, n) = makeKey(bits)

c = encrypt("string", e, n)

m = decrypt(c, d, n)
```

Running it on the command line executes interactively to encrypt and decrypt strings.
