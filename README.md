# RSA in Julia
A simple implementation of RSA in the Julia language.

Originally written for the students at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

The implementation uses *safe primes* for *p* and *q*. This can be
a little slow, but you do not need to do this more than once.

}
```

# Usage

```
(e, d, n) = makeKey(bits)

c = encrypt("string", e, n)

m = decrypt(c, d, n)
```

Running it on the command line executes interactively to encrypt and decrypt strings.
